# ironhack-1st-game

We're prompted to do our 1st game using DOM elements and/or Canvas.

After creating the logic and structure for the game, i started building up the HTML and the CSS. The Javascript was the hard part, given that DOM elements are still a bit hard for me, and to really dig into the logic and where to put things, make it somewhat hard. However, after some google digging, trials and tutorials I managed somehow to construct a normal pong game, which i added to a football pitch, in order to simulate a football game, player vs. player. 

Just another test phrase.
